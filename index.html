      <h2>Buzzed</h2>
      <p>A five-year-old bee met a two-year-old flower.<br />
      That beautiful flower was beside the bee.<br />
      As a bee, you ought to glance at least once for hours—<br />
      It’s a wonder he didn’t do anything, just let it be.</p>

      <p>Time flies; he strayed away from it.<br />
      Some bees did try to prey on the flower,<br />
      Made the flower wrapped in cower,<br />
      And that caused it to almost wilt.</p>

      <p>Eventually, the flower was beside him again.<br />
      Maybe this is where it all begins.<br />
      As he gets closer to the flower,<br />
      The bee keeps on growing fonder.</p>

      <p>For five full years, he had no aim,<br />
      No want, no wish, it was the same.<br />
      But for some strange reason he couldn't explain,<br />
      The bee yearns for that flower again.</p>
